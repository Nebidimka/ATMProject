# ATMProject
Hello my name is Aleksandr Skidelskiy. This is my ATM Java project from Spring semester of 2015.
The goal of the project to show knowledge of how to read and write files in a system, how to create and throw exceptions as well
as creating a basic interactive program.
The java classes state "Created by Zeizara" as it is the handle I use for my personal PC.
